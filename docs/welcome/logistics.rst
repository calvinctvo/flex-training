Logistics
==========

Work schedule
--------------
During your first few months, please come in from 8 AM to 5 PM to match the schedule of your trainers and the rest of the team. We only want you to be successful and the 8-5 window of time gives you the best access to members within the Flex Team and also those from other teams.

Breaks
-------
Please take your breaks. California law requires that employees who work for more than 6 hours take a 30-minute lunch. Liferay policy requires a 1-hour lunch break. Two 15-minute rest breaks are also heavily encouraged, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Liferay policy does not allow combining meal and rest breaks to take a longer lunch period. For more guidelines, see the Employee Handbook.

Cubbies
-------
Since we have an open workspace, we do not have desk storage for our personal things. For that reason, cubbies are provided on the other side of the room from QA. Here is the `Cubby Assignment sheet`_. Claim an empty spot and also physically check if it’s empty. Do not delete someone else’s name from the list. You may keep your things in the cubbies but please do not leave food over the weekend. Diamond Bar is built on a giant anthill and those little critters WILL find any trace of food left around.

Fridays (woop!)
---------------
Liferay has an optional happy hour every Friday at 3:00 PM. Feel free to enjoy this time outside of your normal breaks. Before you leave for the weekend, please clear out your desk leaving nothing on it. There are cleaning wipes on top of the cubbies and we would appreciate it if you could wipe down your table at the end of the week. Please submit your timesheets via `Ultipro`_ before leaving.

Training
--------
This document is a guide, not the last word or the only source for your training. As you proceed through the pages if something does not make sense let your trainer or lead know. Taking notes is highly recommended. There will be checkpoints throughout this document, denoted by ⚠️. These checkpoints are put in place not to test your ability or your knowledge but to ensure that you have a solid foundation for the next step. Make sure to clear these checkpoints before proceeding with training.
