The QA Guild
-------------

At Liferay, it is our mission to make it possible for people to reach their full potential to serve others. What this means as a business, is that it is imperative that we produce good, quality products to allow our customers to create solutions that will help them reach their goals.  As a software company, part of the development process is Quality Assurance, which includes the continuous and thorough testing of products. As a guild, however, we want to advance the boundaries of our impact on quality by looking beyond the activity of testing. We want to go from being known as “Testers” to being known as “Quality Ambassadors,” who advocate for quality throughout the development process and not just during testing. It should be our goal to improve not only on the product but also processes, tools, relationships and even on ourselves as we learn and grow our skills.

Liferay’s QA Program centers on this guiding philosophy: **test the right things, at the right times, in the right ways**. If at any point during a test you feel that there is a better way to test the product, reach out and discuss your ideas with someone from the team.

The QA Guild spans 5 countries with team members throughout the USA, Brazil, China, Italy and Spain, testing all of Liferay’s major products: Liferay Portal, DXP Cloud, Analytics Cloud, Commerce, Web, and Marketplace. As a member of this guild, you join a  group of individuals who are passionate about quality. Our QA Engineers are part of cross-functional Product Teams, working closely with developers, project and product managers, and documentation writers and are making great impact where they are.  As a member of the Flex Team, we are not dedicated to a single product team but we do support them through the following:
#. Release-related manual regression testing;
#. Automation test triage and analysis; and,
#. Defect validation of “Open” and stale tickets.

We are excited that you have joined the Flex team and we are looking forward to getting you situated to be a valuable contributor to the QA guild.

Policies
---------

First, please take a few minutes to look over our `QA Department Guidelines and Policies`_. Especially note the Ergonomic guidelines and the policy on `Scheduling`_. Remember to log your hours in `Ultipro`_ - here's a `quick rundown`_ on how to do that. Should you need more information regarding `Ultipro`_, you can refer to this `loop post by HR`_.

As a department, there are some unwritten policies we conduct our business by and are worth mentioning. First and foremost, we do not try to advance ourselves at someone else’s expense. For example, if you find some useful information that would most certainly help a team member, do not intentionally withhold that information to improve how you appear to management.  Another one is that we don’t waste time. There is always something to do or something to learn. If you find yourself without a task, reach out to your trainer or lead.
