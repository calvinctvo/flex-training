Policies
=========

First, please take a few minutes to look over our `QA Department Guidelines and Policies`_. Especially note the Ergonomic guidelines and the policy on `Scheduling`_. Remember to log your hours in `Ultipro`_ - here's a `quick rundown`_ on how to do that. Should you need more information regarding `Ultipro`_, you can refer to this `loop post by HR`_.

As a department, there are some unwritten policies we conduct our business by and are worth mentioning. First and foremost, we do not try to advance ourselves at someone else’s expense. For example, if you find some useful information that would most certainly help a team member, do not intentionally withhold that information to improve how you appear to management.  Another one is that we don’t waste time. There is always something to do or something to learn. Take the time to look for tasks, read training documents, follow up/close tickets that you previously worked on. If you find yourself completely without a task, reach out to your trainer or lead.
