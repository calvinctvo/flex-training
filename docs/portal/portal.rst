Liferay Portal
==============

What is Liferay Portal?
-----------------------

At its core, Liferay Portal is a platform that allows you to build websites. Companies have used Liferay Portal to build sites both for `internal purposes`_ or for their `customer-facing sites`_. Liferay Portal has also been used for `Collaboration`_, `Student Portals`_, `E-Commerce`_, `Content Management`_, and a host of other solutions. Notice in the links provided, that the industries we touch as a company are not limited to a single stream. We have customers in retail, banking, insurance, manufacturing, and others.

How does it work?
------------------
Liferay provides the tools for our customers/users to build whatever solution they need. All the standard applications (for example, a login feature, site templates, user management or a document library) needed to create a site are provided out of the box. To get started, all a user needs are the Portal code base and the run environment which consists of an application server, and a database. But wait! We bundle those in, too.
Letâ€™s try starting up a portal instance on our local machines.
